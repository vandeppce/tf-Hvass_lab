I rewrited some codes implemented by PrettyTensor originally using Keras.</p>
3b_KerasStopSave.py --> Early-stopping and model saving implemented by Keras.</p>
3c_KerasLoad&Plot.py --> Model Loading and weights getting & plotting implemented by Keras.</p>
5a_EnsembleKeras.py --> Ensemble Learning implemented by Keras.</p>
6a_Keras_CIFAR-10.py --> Processing CIFAR-10 dataset by Keras.</p>
8a_KerasTransferLearning.py --> Transfer Learning implemented by Keras.</p>
9a_KerasVideoData.py --> Processing Knifey&Spoony dataset implemented by Keras.</p>
11a_RewriteAdversary.py --> Rewrite codes for adversarial examples, and an image of panda is used for testing the codes.</p>
